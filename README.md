## Project Objective

Build a daily feedback app with multiple page views. This project was meant to solidify the usage of redux reducers and working with global state outside of App.

## Features

Users can:

-   Add feedback in the form of answering questions
-   View and edit their answers before submission
-   Restart the questionnaire after submission

Admins can:

-   View all feedback
-   Flag feedback that needs to be followed up with
-   Delete feedback from dashboard

## What I Learned

-   The flow of dispatching data and bringing that data back into the components using redux
-   Routing to different pages on events using react-router-dom
